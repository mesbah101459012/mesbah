Since libsodium is cross-platform, this also makes it easier to communicate with PHP from, e.g. Java applets or native mobile apps.
WebRTC is the Internet standard that makes it possible to do live video calls right inside a web browser.

=======================
HTTP/1.1 header fields
=======================
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.
HTTP headers are the code that transfers data between a Web server and a client. HTTP headers are mainly intended for the communication between the server and client in both directions.
HTTP Entity Header
These headers include information regarding:

Allow (methods supported by the identified resource)
Content Encoding.
Content Language.
Content Location.
Content Length.
MD-5 (for checking the integrity of the message upon receipt).
Content Range.
Content Type.
When it Expires.
When it was last modified.
